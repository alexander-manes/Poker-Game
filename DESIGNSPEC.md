# Poker-Game
## Game/Instructions
### How to run the game:
Unfortunately, I did not realize that for Kotlin to be compiled into a Jar file, I needed gradle installed on my device, and do not have my own computer, I used the schools, which did not allow for me to compile it. The program still runs in an IDE such as Intellij and I hope that can work. To run it, just run it from the Game.kt file. 
#### Rules:
This is a simple game of poker. Five cards are dealt to each player and the player with the best hand wins (see hand combos here https://www.cardplayer.com/rules-of-poker/hand-rankings). In between deals, each player can bet or fold which means they will not take part in the round. At the end, the winning player gets the sum of all the bets from that round.
## Architecture Design
The card game is as follows:
![Architecture](https://github.com/alexander-manes/Poker-Game/blob/master/Architecture.jpg)
As you can see, there is a heavy amount of abstraction, especially when calculating the values of a hand (the Hand Class has two separate classes to do so). I did this because there were 8 rather complicated methods to test the different types of hands and using two helper classes meant for cleaner code and made testing easier. The abstraction also followed common sense. A player has a hand and that is made up of five different cards.

I chose to use Kotlin to program for this project for two major reasons. First, it is a language with which I am very comfortable. Second, its built-in null safety eliminated the chance of null-pointer errors, which is always a fear with so much abstraction.

Overall, the library and data-structure I used were on purpose using native vanilla to help the the game run fast. I chose the simple data structure of an array to store the cards. The main complication came when evaluating the value of an array. I did this with separate functions such as “isRoyalFlush()” to test different hand types. To make some tests easier, I used “selection sort” to sort the hand by rank and suit. Then I knew the position of other cards, e.g.a pair would be next to each other. 

## Tests
I wrote tests to test the different “handtype” functions in the HandValue class. However, when I lost the code for this project due to a git error, I felt it was necessary to re-write them since I knew the logic was sound. I have re-written the “isRoyalFlush()” test to show how they looked.
